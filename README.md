<h1 align="center">Alsatian: Optimizing Model Search for Deep Transfer Learning</h1>
<p align="center">This repository contains the code to our SIGMOD 2025 <a href="https://hpi.de/oldsite/fileadmin/user_upload/fachgebiete/rabl/publications/2025/alsatian-double-column.pdf"> paper<a/>.
  For an overview of our (additional) experiments look into the experiments folder of this repo.<p/>

## General Info

- We developed our system under the name **_MOSIX_** and later renamed it to _Alsatian_.
- Large files like datasets, model snapshots, or large log files of experiments are not contained in the repo. If you
  need access please feel free to reach out to us!

## Reproducibility

- **For Reproducibility please switch to the branch `reproducibility`** and checkout the readme in the folder
  `reproducibility` this branch contains boiled down script to reproduce only the experiments in the paper.

## Repository Structure

- [setup](setup) contains information on the hardware and software setup we use.
- [model_search](model_search) contains the implementation of _Alsatian_(_Mosix_), the baseline, and the successive
  halving approach.
- [experiments](experiments) contains the scripts to execute and analyze/plot the experiments in our paper. We structure
  them into:
    - _main experiments_: Experiments that are described in detail in our paper.
    - _side experiments_: Experiments we ran to get additional insights but that do not directly correspond
      to an experiment in main our paper (you might find them in the appendix).
    - _micro benchmarks_: Evaluation of sub-operations that helped us making design decisions.
- [data](data) contains information on how to download, access, and prepare the datasets used in our experiments.
- [custom](custom) contains models, data loaders, and short scripts. These files are mostly slight adjustments
  or minor extensions of PyTorch files and helper scripts that made the development and analysis easier.
- [global utils](global_utils) is a collection of constants, helper methods, and scripts we use as part of Alsatian or
  our
  evaluation.
