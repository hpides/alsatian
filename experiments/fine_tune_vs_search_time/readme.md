# Fine Tune VS Search Time Experiment

- in this experiment we want to get insights in how long a typical fine-tuning process takes and compare it to the time
  it takes to search through a set of models
- we perform the following experiments

## Hardware

- setup 1: Groups GPU server
  - we run on our groups GPU server
  - inside a docker container that has access to 1 GPU, and 32 of the CPUs
- setup 2: slurm 
  - TBD

## Experiments
- we consider the following set of models
  - TBD
- we use the following data and dataset sizes
  - TBD

## Results and plotting
