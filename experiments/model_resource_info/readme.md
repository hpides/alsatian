## Experiment

- We just want to get basic insights into intermediate and parameter sizes of models we will use for our evaluation
- We might extend this experiment in the future to analyze models not only on a block but on a layer granularity

#### Results

- the experiment was executed on the hardware as described in [readme.md](..%2F..%2Fexp_environment%2Freadme.md)
  and is also documented in every single result file
- the single result files can be found here: TODO insert path
