# Group's GPU server
- for development purposes we use our group's GPU server
- checkout our internal hpi-setup repo to see how to setup a docker container with CUDA support and how to SSH into it
- once that is done we use PyCharms ssh remote development functionality
- before running sth make sure to exclude venv and some data paths in the PyCharm settings, otherwise the entire local venc is copied over
